You've forked a repo, made changes, and now want to make a clean version for a pull request.

To make a new branch corresponding to the forked repo:

> git branch <new-branch-name> <SHA of the original forked repo>

Change to that branch.

Copy over the changes you want to add to the pull request. Commit those changes to this branch.

Make a new branch from this current branch and tag it just for this pull request.

Then make the pull request, using the tagged branch.

---------------------

There are new changes on the original repo you forked.

To merge new changes back from the forked repo:

Change your working branch to the one that has the original forked repo (as discussed before).

Add a remote to your git:
> git remote add <remote_name> <remote URL from github>

Then merge the remote changes to the working branch.
> git pull <remote_name> master (presumably you are pulling from the remote's master branch)

Then you can merge this branch into whatever working branch you like.
